          %h4 What is Quantum Computing
          %p
            %small
              %i This introduction to quantum computing was written for the SIGDA newsletter.
          %p
            Quantum computers perform computations based on the counter-intuitive
            effects of quantum mechanics, which allows them to solve some problems
            in a lower complexity compared to classical computers.  What is a bit
            to classical computers is a qubit to quantum computers.  A qubit's two
            most powerful properties are superposition and entanglement.
            Superposition enables qubits to represent exponential many states at
            the same time.  Entanglement allows to affect the state of several
            qubits, even when operating only on a single one.  Several quantum
            algorithms have already been discovered, which can harness the power
            of a quantum computer to eventually solve complex problems more
            efficiently.  The most prominent one is arguably Shor's algorithm that
            can factorize integers in polynomial time.  However, other more
            abstract algorithms play a significant role in scientific applications
            of high interest.  These are Grover's search algorithm which enables
            faster database queries, the HHL algorithm which brings an exponential
            speedup to solve linear equations, and quantum simulation to model
            atomic-scale interactions efficiently, allowing to approximate
            behavior in drugs, organics, and materials in areas like medicine,
            chemistry, and engineering, respectively [1].
          %p
            The progress in building physical fully-programmable quantum computers
            has rapidly accelerated in the last few years [2].  Examples are the
            17-qubit quantum computer from IBM based on superconducting circuits
            (a 16-qubit variant can be freely accessed and programmed via a cloud
            service), the 9-qubit quantum computer from Google based on
            superconducting qubits [3], and the 5-qubit ion trap based quantum
            computer developed at the University of Maryland [4].  Microsoft is
            working on a topological quantum computer.  So far, no physical
            topological quantum computer has been demonstrated, however,
            topological qubits promise to be far superior compared to the
            superconducting ones, thereby requiring less error correction and
            therefore enabling larger scalability.  Intel is aiming at developing
            a silicon qubit arguing that they are more likely to scale up to
            thousand or millions of qubits [5].
          %p
            Researchers call "quantum supremacy" an experiment that demonstrates a
            calculation that is beyond the reach of any conventional computer [6].
            It is believed that one needs a quantum computer that operates on at
            least 49 qubits to show quantum supremacy [7].  Quantum algorithms can
            be simulated classically on supercomputers by explicitly representing
            all quantum states using exponential-size memory.  The world record in
            simulated qubits is currently at 45 qubits, which were simulated on
            the Cori II supercomputer using 8192 nodes and 0.5 petabytes of memory
            [8].  The computational task in that experiment is the execution of
            low-depth random quantum circuits, which beyond the demonstration of
            quantum supremacy is not scientifically useful.  But there exist very
            practical problems that can be solvable with just a few more qubits.
            It is assumed that it takes 100 qubits for a thorough analysis of the
            energy-intensive nitrogenase reaction to make fertilizer in just a few
            days, whereas todays supercomputers need billion of years.  The
            implication of such an analysis might be a cut of 1&ndash;2% in global
            natural-gas consumption [9].
          %p
            The efforts in developing software to program quantum computers once
            they are available is comparatively small compared to what has been
            done in designing hardware for quantum computing.  While for quantum
            computers the aim is to increase the number of qubits that can be
            programmed, at the software and design automation side researchers try
            to reduce the number of qubits and quantum interactions that are
            required to implement a quantum algorithm.  Microsoft is pushing
            forward this field and aims to support the whole software stack,
            starting from user interfaces and code compilers to machine
            instructions that are suitable to run on various physical quantum
            computers.  Design automation is crucial to realize quantum algorithms
            using few qubits and few operations.  While for example the quantum
            linear systems algorithm requires only 100 quantum bits to encode a
            2<sup>100</sup> &times; 2<sup>100</sup> matrix inversion problem [10], clearly demonstrating the
            advantage that can be gained by using a quantum computer, in prior
            approaches, the reciprocal step (1/x) that is part of the calculation
            can require in excess of 500 quantum bits.  This means that
            arithmetic may dominate the number of qubits of that algorithm [11],
            diminishing the potential improvements of a quantum algorithmic
            implementation.  Recent research in design automation therefore
            addresses the efficient compilation of classical arithmetic components
            such as floating point components into quantum operations [12].
